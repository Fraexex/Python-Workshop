# Python-Workshop
Python Workshop teaching basic Git functionality and Python basics through challenges

##1. Basic Syntax and Data Types
- Lesson 1 - Data Types: Play around with python's different data-types; differentiate between int, float, bool, str, and string.
- Lesson 2 - Variables: Create variables of different data types (string, integer, float, boolean) and print them.
- Lesson 3 - Arithmetic: Create a simple calculator that takes two numbers and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- Lesson 4 - Logic Gates: Use AND and OR to check between two Variables
- Lesson 5 - Booleans: Delve further into what it means for a variable to be True or False

## 2. Control Flow
- Even or Odd: Write a program that takes a number and prints whether it's even or odd.
- Grade Calculator: Use if-else statements to determine letter grades based on numeric input.

## 3. Loops
- Counting: Write a program that counts from 1 to 10 using a for loop and prints each number.
- Guess the Number: Create a simple game where the program randomly selects a number between 1 and 20, and the user has to guess it. Provide hints for too high/too low.

## 4. Functions
- Simple Functions: Ceate functions for common tasks (e.g., a function to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit).
- Factorial: Write a function that calculates the factorial of a given number.

## 5. Lists and Dictionaries
- List Manipulation: Create a list of favorite foods and have students write functions to add, remove, and display items.
- Dictionary Exercise: Create a dictionary of student names and their grades, then write a function to find the average grade.

## 6. String Manipulation
- Palindrome Checker: Write a program that checks if a given string is a palindrome.
- Word Count: Create a program that counts the number of words in a given string.

## 7. File Handling
- Reading and Writing Files: Teach them how to read from a text file and write user input to a file.
- Log Creator: Write a simple program that logs user actions (e.g., timestamp and action) to a file.

## 8. Basic Object-Oriented Programming
- Class and Objects: Create a simple Dog class with attributes like name and age, and methods like bark().
- Inheritance: Create subclasses and use inheritance with a basic example (e.g., Animal class and Dog, Cat subclasses).

## Projects
- To-Do List App: A simple command-line application where users can add, view, and delete tasks. Bonus points for GUI!
- Simple Quiz Game: Create a quiz with multiple-choice questions, keeping score as users answer. Bonus points for GUI!
